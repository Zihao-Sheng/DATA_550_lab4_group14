    "\n",
    "First, I just want to thank you for bringing me back to my senses and stopping my world domination attempt and silly startup idea. I don't know what happen, but I clearly wasn't myself there for a while. Now that you have brought me back to normal, I would like design this lab more similar to the first one and go through a topic that I find intriguing and ponder-worthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, instead of looking around us, we will look inside. Ever since I arrived on this planet, I have been fascinated about your use of airborn oscillations to transmit information generated by electrical impulses. And the fact that you rely on muscular dexterity for the encoding process as well as passive mechnotransduction for the decoding is truly remarkable (in a primitive sense of course, I guess how your kind can appreciate \"the remarkable complexity\" of a cave painting). Such a system is clearly a bottleneck in terms of information bandwidth and I am surprised a more direct means of intercranial transmission never evolved here, but from the perspective of my research on less evolved galactic lifeforms I find this fascinating!\n",
    "\n",
    "After hearing that there are over 7,000 languages spoken across this globe, I am curious whether some of these at least allow for more rapid information transmission than others. The implications of this reach beyond just communication as I have recently learned that you also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could literally upgrade your thought throughput by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!"

If you want to read part of the article, I recommend that you do it after attempting to answer the questions (or if you get stuck) since it will give away some of the things that we can otherwise \"discover\" ourselves. There is also a popular science version of this article publish in The Economist, and I link to both in the optional question at the end.\n",

No language appears to be particularly efficient in the sense of simultaneously exhibiting both high information density and a high speech rate. However, English stands out slightly, as it combines relatively high information density while maintaining a comparatively high speech rate."

    "These results are looking pretty promising, now we just need to add a narrative so that it will be easy for others to follow along with what we have done here. Tell a story using the three plots we have created. Build it up according to the principles and examples from this week's required readings. In your story you can refer to the plots as plot A,B, and C. You story should make it clear what the plot is telling us and how it motivates the next plot we're making so that there is a clear story line for the reader to follow as well as a clear take home message (there might be many messages in these plots, so you can choose which to focus on). No need to write an essay here, a succinct paragraph per plot should do it.\n",

    "Plot A shows that languages with higher information density tend to have a larger inventory of distinct syllables, suggesting that increased phonological complexity is one way languages encode more information. However, this alone does not describe how efficiently information is conveyed over time. Plot B therefore examines speech rate and reveals a clear trade-off: as information density increases, speech rate generally decreases, and no language is simultaneously high in both. This pattern suggests a potential cognitive constraint on how quickly auditory information can be processed. Motivated by this observation, Plot C directly compares the information rate—the amount of information conveyed per second—across languages at the speaker level. Despite differences in information density and speech rate, the distributions of information rate are relatively similar across languages, with substantial overlap in their means and confidence intervals. Together, these results indicate that languages achieve comparable overall rates of information transmission by balancing information density and speech rate in different ways, consistent with a shared limit on human auditory processing."

    "The Economist simplifies the original scientific figure by reducing visual complexity and emphasizing the main message rather than methodological details. It removes confidence intervals and most color encodings, instead placing each language on its own clearly labeled row, making color unnecessary for differentiation. The use of a clearer, more descriptive title and brief explanatory labels further helps readers quickly understand the comparison being made. \n",

    "Figure A shows text-normalized relative speech rates by language, revealing that while absolute speaking speed varies across texts, the relative ordering of languages is remarkably stable. Languages that are faster on average tend to remain faster across nearly all texts, and slower languages remain consistently slower, indicating that text content does not substantially alter which languages are faster. Figure B aggregates speech rates at the continent level and shows that Europe consistently exhibits higher mean speech rates than Asia across all texts, with parallel trends suggesting minimal interaction between text and continent. Finally, Figure C quantifies sensitivity to text content by measuring variability in mean speech rate across texts. Although some languages display greater text sensitivity than others, this variability affects the magnitude of speech rate rather than reversing language or continent-level rankings. Taken together, these results suggest that text content influences overall speaking speed but does not fundamentally change relative speech rate patterns across languages or continents."

    "- There is evidence that the words we have at our disposal influences how we think. This could mean that certain thought patterns and emotions might be more accessible in languages where they are more easily verbalized, and maybe we would have slightly different thoughts if we knew another language (the reference here is the weak form of the Sapiro-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, not the strong version). After you are done with the lab, I recommend listening to [this talk by Lera Boroditsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k) or watching the movie \"Arrival\" (although they go a bit far...) if you are interested in learning more about this (it's fun to think about!)."
